# "Secret Channel" ðŸ¤«

> Streaming authenticated encryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305 ([RFC 8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439)) (or other [AEADs](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/secret-key_cryptography/aead)).

A protocol for a secure message stream, after you've done a secure key exchange.

(Note: This protocol has not been audited to be safe. Use at your own risk.)

## Pre-requisites

- The channel must be reliable and ordered: i.e. TCP.
- Each channel key must be an ephemeral key for a single channel and discarded when the channel ends.
  - To get a channel key, do a secure key exchange first: e.g. [Noise](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html) or [Secret Handshake](https://dominictarr.github.io/secret-handshake-paper/shs.pdf).
- Each channel has one sender (encrypter) and one receiver (decrypter).
  - For a duplex (bi-directional) connection between peers, create two secret channels (with two separate keys), one in each direction.
- A (key, nonce) pair must NEVER be re-used.

## Security Guarantees

Secret Channel protects the stream from:

- Stream truncation: avoided by checking for "end-of-stream" as the final chunk.
- Chunk removal: the wrong nonce would be used, producing an AEAD decryption error.
- Chunk reordering: the wrong nonce would be used, producing an AEAD decryption error.
- Chunk duplication: the wrong nonce would be used, producing an AEAD decryption error.
- Chunk modification: this is what an AEAD is designed to detect.
